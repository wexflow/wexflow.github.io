  "about.description1": "Wexflow is an open-source workflow engine licensed under MIT. This means you're free to use, modify, share, or even sell it. Wexflow is more like a task automation and scheduling platform. It focuses on automating technical jobs like moving or uploading files, sending emails, running scripts, or scheduling batch processes. It's great when you want to automate system tasks easily without writing much code. For more complex scenarios, you can create your own custom activities, install them, and use them to extend its capabilities.",
  "about.cta": "Get Started",
  "about.title2": "Is Wexflow a Business Process Management Solution?",
  "about.description2": "Wexflow is primarily a workflow automation engine, not a full BPM suite. Wexflow does not natively support BPMN, human workflows, or built-in user forms. So if your business processes require a lot of human interaction, approvals, or business rule evaluation, Wexflow would be limited.<br><br>Wexflow excels at automating technical tasks, such as moving or transforming files, uploading to FTP/SFTP, running scripts (PowerShell, Bash, Python, etc.), scheduling and chaining tasks, triggering workflows by events, manual input, cron or watchfolders, designing flows visually (Designer UI), integrating with APIs and databases, supporting conditional logic (if/else, switch, while).<br><br>You can use Wexflow if your processes are mostly system-based, such as back-office automation (file syncing, reporting, monitoring), ETL pipelines, DevOps or IT operations automation or API integrations between systems.",
